		In the beginning, there were three goddesses, Queyalla, Seephir, and Arballum. In any infinity of universes, it is only logical that there appears one in which the chaos is able to be ordered. In the chaos of the ether emerged these three, the creators of all things, and bent the chaos to their desires. Millenia passed before they grew bored of their power. In their boredom, they condensed the chaos into physical matter, making a giant swathe that extended leagues upon leagues. They then dubbed this mass, Ferenor. Yet, Ferenor... The rest of the chaos, for there was still more, was released by the three goddesses and allowed to expand into the nothingness.
